Google Metadata plugin
====

This plugin provides a basic framework for steps in a buildâ€™s
lifecycle to attach JSON-serializable metadata to a build (as an
invisible action).

This metadata can be produced and attached by any build step (samples
forthcoming).

This metadata can then be attached to build artifacts (see our Google
Cloud Storage plugin for an example of this).
